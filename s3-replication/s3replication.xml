Cross account replication, s3 batch replication

Versioning should be enabled on both buckets
Replication config. (as XML) won't replicate objects that existed before adding config.
Replication config. should have destination bucket, and objects to be replicated
With objects it also replicates ACLs, the owner in destination remains same unless othersie stated
Objects that are already replicas, created by another CRR in the source, are not replicated.
AWS S3 replicates metadata from the source objects to the replicas only.

1. Create a role for source bucket and pass it in a replication rule for that source bucket
2. Attach bucket policy to destination bucket
