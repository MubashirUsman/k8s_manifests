# Generator: List (a literal list with elements, e.g cluster name and ip), Cluster (you ensure that new clusters are defined within argocd cluster list)
# Git Generator: json file in git is edited and generators are updated
# With generator we can generate parameters to be substituted in applications
# "The purpose of the Generator is to target argocd applications to clusters and different environments"
# ApplicationSet controller is Used for add-ons and deploying applications to multiple clusters
# Argocd Controller create/update/delete Application resource, 
# takes ApplicationSet resource as input, and outputting one or more Argo CD Application resources
# Application's k8s resources are created by argocd as defined in spec field
