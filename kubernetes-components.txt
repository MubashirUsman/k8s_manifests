Kube-scheduler 
    decides which pods go on which node based on the needs of the pod and capacity of the node.
    Kube-scheduler criteria:
        filters out nodes which do not fit the criteria, 
        ranks nodes and places on the node which wins
        This criteria can be changed, based on request/limits, taints/tolerations, node selectors/affinity
