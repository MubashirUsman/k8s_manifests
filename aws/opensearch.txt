Cluster health and Instance health

CPUUtilization -> max, avg
    The %age of cpu usage for data nodes, max shows the node with
    highest cpu usage. Average of all nodes in cluster.
FreeStorageSpace -> Sum, Min, Max
    ClusterBlockException is thrown when FreeStorageSpace = 0
    Min/Max is least/most free space on nodes.
    Sum shows total free space.
JVMMemoryPressure
    The max %age of java heap used for all nodes.
ClusterIndexWritesBlocked
    Shows if cluster is accepting/blocking write requests
    accepting = 0, blocking=1
    Factors are FreeStorageSpace and JVMMemoryPressure
