S3 Batch Replication is built using S3 Batch Operations to replicate objects as fully managed Batch Operations jobs.

you pay the S3 charges for storage in the selected destination S3 storage classes, 
    for the primary copy, for replication PUT requests, and for applicable infrequent 
    access storage retrieval charges. 
When replicating across AWS Regions, you also pay for inter-Region Data Transfer OUT 
    from S3 to each destination Region.
In addition to these charges, you also pay the S3 Batch Operations charges for Batch Replication jobs.

Batch Operations – Jobs =	$0.25 per job
Batch Operations – Objects =	$1.00 per million objects processed
Batch Operations – Manifest (optional) =	$0.015 per 1 million objects in the source bucket
