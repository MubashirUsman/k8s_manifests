list: sequence of values which are iterable ["us-west-1a", "us-west-1c"]
map: a group of values identified by named labels {name = "Mabel", age = 52}
list and map are complex data types

A literal expression is an expression that directly represents a particular constant value.

Terraform's for_each meta-argument allows you to configure a set of similar resources
    by iterating over a data structure (like map) to configure a resource for each item in that 
    data structure. 
    Use for_each to customize a set of similar resources that share the same lifecycle.
    for_each supports lists and maps

This Terraform configuration defines multiple VPCs, assigning each key/value pair 
    in the var.project map to each.key and each.value respectively. When you use 
    for_each with a list or set, each.key is the index of the item in the collection, 
    and each.value is the value of the item.
    
    for_each.<variable-name-of-list-map>
    then use each.key.<each-key-name-inside-map> or each.value.<varibale-name>
