# The RBAC API has four K8s objects: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding, ClusterRoleBinding
# Service Accounts/Role
# In Kubernetes, service accounts are used to provide an identity for pods or processess that run inside the pod. 
# Pods that want to interact with the API server will authenticate with a particular service account.
# After creating a role, you create a role-binding to bind the role with service account
# Every pod created without specifying the service account gets assigned a default service account of that namespace
# A service account has a token which is stored as a secret
# To use a custom serviceAccount, specify the serviceAccountName field in POD template
# Three Steps: 1. Create a Service Account 2. Create a Role 3. Bind that Role to the Service Account.
