# Every pod has a unique IP throughout the cluster
# Pods get their own network namespace on the node and can talk to other pods on all nodes without NAT
# Ports are shared among containers in the same pod and can reach each other on localhost.
# Each network namespace can have their own networking rules, those can range from firewall rules, interfaces (virtual or 
# physical), routes, and everything else networking-related. Virtual interfaces are created from the physical interface.
# 
# When a pod is created, container runtime creates a network namespace, and then CNI assigns an IP to it and attach the conatainer(s) to the network (same namespace)
