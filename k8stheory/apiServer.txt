There is a process that always runs on api Server 
Authenticating
    Service Accounts are users managed by K8s api
    K8s uses client certificates, bearer tokens, or an authenticating proxy to authenticate API requests
    As HTTP requests are made to the API server, plugins attempt to associate the following attributes with the request:
    Username, UID, Groups are associated to the HTTP request by authentication plugins.
    X509 Client Certs
    Client certificate authentication is enabled by passing the --client-ca-file=SOMEFILE option
     to API server. The referenced file must contain one or more certificate authorities to use 
     to validate client certificates presented to the API server.
    Static Token File 
     The API server reads bearer tokens from a file when given the --token-auth-file=SOMEFILE 
     option on the command line. Currently, tokens last indefinitely, and the token list cannot 
     be changed without restarting the API server.
     The token file is a csv file with a minimum of 3 columns: token, user name, user uid, followed 
     by optional group names.
