# The AWS Load Balancer Controller creates ALBs and the necessary supporting AWS 
# resources whenever a Kubernetes ingress resource is created on the cluster with 
# the "kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb" annotation.

# Ingress Annotations
# To share an application load balancer across multiple service resources use IngressGroups with the following annotation:
# Use the same ingressGroup to share the same ALB
# alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: my-group


# alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/scheme: internet-facing
# 1. The nodes of internet facing LB have public IP
# 2. The DNS name of an internet-facing load balancer is publicly resolvable to the public IP addresses of the nodes. 
# Therefore, internet-facing load balancers can route requests from clients over the internet.
