# JSON Policy element: Principal
# IAM Principal that creates the cluster is automatically granted the 
# permission of system:masters in RBAC 

# To grant more IAM principals the ability to interact with the cluster
# edit the aws-auth configMap and create the roleBinding or clusterRoleBinding
# with the name of the group that was specified in the aws-auth configMap.
kubectl describe -n kube-system configmap/aws-auth
